This recipe has just 4 ingredients: water, yeast, flour, and salt. But the results are magical. And it’s all because of the technique!

Start by dissolving the yeast in warm water.

While that is doing its magic, combine the flour and salt. Create a little well in the center, and add in the yeast. Stir it around, taking flour from the outside edge and bringing it into the well, a little at a time.

Next add in a bit of cool water. Keep stirring, and adding water as needed, until a shaggy dough forms. Now just cover it loosely, and let it rest.

For this type of bread, there’s not a lot of kneading involved. It only needs a few quick folds, to become smooth and build strength, without overworking the gluten and causing toughness.

Place the dough into a greased bowl and cover it tightly. Allow it to proof (or rise) in a warm place until doubled in bulk.

Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, and shape into long logs (about 15 inches long) with pointed ends. Nestle the loaves in to a floured kitchen towel, cover with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise a second time.

While the baguettes are rising, fill a baking pan with water and place it in the bottom of your oven. Preheat the oven and allow it to fill with steam from the water. This is the KEY to a crusty baguette.

Once the loaves have finished their second rise, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle them with a little flour. Then quickly slash them with a lame, razor blade, or sharp knife. This is decorative, but it also allows the crust to crack and the bread to expand in a more controlled way.

Place them in the oven and let them bake until deeply golden brown. They should feel light and dry on the outside, and when you tap them they should give a hollow sound.
